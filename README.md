Bootstrap Bakery

The assignment: build a simple chatbot.

We decided to keep it quite simple since we are beginners at JavaScript. We thought that a food ordering bot with just a few options would be a good choice for us. We got some help from our team when we had trouble getting the bot conversation started, besides that we re-watched the code sessions and did a lot of googling. We also used Beautify to make our code look tidy.

If we had more time we would play around with the styling and add some sound effects to the chat.
